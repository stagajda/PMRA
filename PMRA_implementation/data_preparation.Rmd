Read results of 49 models obtained in Models Running.ipynb (KNN0 excluded)
Computing time for all 49 models may be long, use 30 instead to check how PMRA works
```{r}
credit_results <- read.csv(file = "wyniki_all.csv")
credit_results_final = credit_results[credit_results$iter_num == 1,c("Model", "split_num", "AUC_score")]
colnames(credit_results_final) <- c("player", "round", "score")
rownames(credit_results_final) <- NULL
credit_results_final <- credit_results_final[1:400,]

```
